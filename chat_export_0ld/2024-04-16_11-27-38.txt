2024-04-16 11:27:38 Meeran: short poem on awating death
2024-04-16 11:27:38 gemini: In shadows deep, I patiently abide,
Awaiting death's embrace,. my soul to guide.
No fear or longing clouds my tranquil mind,
For in the twilight, peace I seek to find.

Withdrawn from world.'s distractions, I retreat,
Into the stillness, where my heart will meet
The unknown realm, where secrets lie concealed,
Where mysteries of life and death are revealed.

As night descends, a gentle breeze will blow,
Whispering secrets that my spirit knows.
The stars above will twinkle,. guiding my way,
As I embark on death's eternal sway.

No tears or sorrows shall accompany me there,
Only a sense of calm, beyond compare.
In death's embrace, my soul will find release,
A journey's end, where pain and strife will cease.
